    <blockquote>

        <p>
            Arashi is a idol group from <strong>Japan </strong> consisting of five members formed under the Johnny's Entertainment talent agency. THe members are Satoshi Ohno, Sho Sakurai, Masaki Aiba, Kazunari Ninomiya, and Jun Matsumoto. The group was officially formed on <em> September 15, 1999 </em> in Honolulu, Hawaii, and made their CD debut on November 3, 1999.
        </p>


        <p>
            The group was initially signed to Pony Canyon and released one studio album and six singles beginning with their 1999 eponymous debut single before moving to the Johnny's subsidiary label J Storm in 2001, which was initially set up for their succeeding releases. While their debut single debuted atop the Oricon weekly chart selling a little over half a million copies, the group subsequently faced slowly declining sales.
        </p>


        <p>
            With the release of their eighteenth single "Love So Sweet", Arashi began to gain commercial success as "Love So Sweet" was used as the opening theme song for the high-rating drama Hana Yori Dango 2, making it one of the top five best-selling singles of 2007 in Japan and the group's first single to exceed 400,000 copies sold overall in nearly seven years.
